- List exact files you plan to touch.

Output format:
1) Scope: what will change / what will not change
2) Packages involved
3) Files to read first
4) Implementation plan (step-by-step)
5) Verification plan: which commands to run per package
6) Risks / rollback plan

Ask for approval before coding.
